## Inspiration

Managing room reservations and allocations can be a daunting task without the right system in place. My inspiration for creating this Room Allotment System stemmed from the need to streamline the process of room and chair allocation efficiently. The goal was to design a user-friendly application that leverages C++ programming to handle the complexities of room management, making it easier for users to set up rooms, reserve slots, and keep track of room capacity in an organized manner.

## What it Does

The Room Allotment System is a comprehensive application designed to facilitate the management of rooms and their capacities. Users can:

- Set up new rooms with specific details such as room number, name, host, start time, end time, and chair capacity.
- Reserve slots within rooms, ensuring no overbooking occurs.
- View a list of all available rooms.
- Check the capacity and availability of chairs in each room.
- Get detailed information about a specific room, including the number of remaining chairs and occupant names.

## How it Works

Built using C++, this application utilizes class-based design to encapsulate room details and operations. Key features include:

- **Room Setup**: Allows users to configure new rooms with all necessary details.
- **Slot Reservation**: Ensures users can reserve chairs within a room without exceeding its capacity.
- **Availability Check**: Provides an overview of available rooms and their capacities.
- **Detailed Room Information**: Offers in-depth details about specific rooms, including a list of remaining chairs and their current occupants.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C++

## Challenges

- Ensuring accurate and efficient management of room and chair allocations.
- Implementing dynamic memory allocation to handle varying chair capacities within rooms.
- Providing a user-friendly interface via a command-line application.
- Maintaining the integrity and usability of data throughout the application's lifecycle.

## Accomplishments

I am proud to have developed a functional Room Allotment System that simplifies room management tasks. This project showcases my skills in C++ programming and object-oriented design. The application not only meets the initial requirements but also includes dynamic features for improved user interaction and data management.

## What I Learned

This project has been a valuable learning experience, enhancing my understanding of:

- Object-oriented programming in C++.
- Dynamic memory management and efficient data handling.
- Designing user-friendly command-line applications.
- Implementing robust error handling and validation techniques.

## What's Next

Moving forward, I plan to enhance the Room Allotment System by:

- Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more intuitive user experience.
- Integrating a database for persistent data storage and retrieval.
- Implementing additional features such as room search functionality and reporting tools.
- Enhancing the system's scalability to handle larger datasets and more complex allocation rules.
